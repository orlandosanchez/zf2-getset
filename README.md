this a quick, dirty and ugly php script for creating zf2 entity models that really saves me a bunch of time

## Usage

php zf2-getset.sh NameOfClass variable1 variable2 variable3

the arguements for the zf2-getset bash script are simple. the first variable is the name of the class and the rest are a list of of the class properties.
